Project 1

Implement Logistic Regression

Predict each applicant¡¯s chance of admission to university based on their results on two exams.

Use historical data from previous applicants in ex1data1.txt to select which city to expand to next.

Data Description
The first two columns is the scores on two exams and the last column is the result of the admission.

* Visualizing data set
* Using fminunc for gradient descent
* Evaluating the logistic regression model

Project 2

Implement regularized logistic regression

Predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance(QA). 

Predict market price of house.
Collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.

Use the dataset of test results on past microchips in ex1data2.txt.

Data Description
The first two columns is the scores on two tests and the last column is the result of the QA

* Visualizing data set
* To fit the data better, using function mapFeature.m to generate higher polynomial terms
* Using Regularized Cost Function and gradient
* Using fminunc for gradient descent
* Visualizing decision boundary on data set
* Evaluating the logistic regression model
